            <h3>Hi, I'm Will Hunt</h3>
            <p>I build and service garden beds.</p>
            <p class="padded">
                <span class="emphasize">Hunt Garden Beds</span> was started in April of 2020 and it has been our goal since then 
                to bring high quality and long lasting Garden Beds to any one daring enough to go 
                back to their roots and start a garden. Whether this garden is a <span class="emphasize"> small personal 
                garden</span> for a first timer, a <span class="emphasize">large kitchen</span> garden for a veteran, or even a <span class="emphasize">corporate 
                office</span> trying to give back to their employees, we strive to provide you with exactly 
                what you are hoping to achieve with your new, <span class="emphasize">hand-built</span> garden bed.
            </p>
            <p class="padded">
                Every garden bed built at Hunt Garden Beds is built from a selection of handpicked 
                white cedar from local lumber yards in the North Shore of Boston and then assembled 
                in Newburyport Massachusetts. We believe each bed we deliver is an investment into 
                yourselves or your company, and so we strive to ensure your investment will last. 
                Every bed consists of a heavy duty structural build using 2”x6” cedar wall boards 
                cut to your beds specific length as well as 4”x4” corner pieces. On certain designs, 
                we feature an optional trim set that covers any seams on the structural pieces as well 
                as a top board that is able to be used as a seat while tending to the garden (this 
                option is required for use of the critter cage). Beds with a longer design also come 
                standard with a stainless steel cable installed with galvanized hardware to prevent 
                any possible bowing that could occur with the natural aging of the wood, or from the 
                weight of the soil used. All of our beds are built to last for years to come and with 
                the expectation that no maintenance will be required during the bed’s lifespan. In the 
                unlikely event that any maintenance is needed or a board needs to be replaced, those 
                individual pieces can be taken out, and replaced without the need of a whole new bed.
